            <img src="./imgs/ultron fire image.jpg" alt="ultron in fire" width="184"  height="370.75">
        <p> Ultron is an artificially intelligent robot <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baug78J1Ap4">created </a> by <a target="_blank" href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Iron_Man">Tony Stark</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Bruce_Banner_(Earth-616)">Bruce Banner </a>. He is known for his ability to process information, hack and access anything online, upload his consciousness on the internet, make calculations, upgrade his appearance and many other abilities. He was originally created in order to help the Avengers protect Earth from danger. He thought of humanity itself to be a danger to the Earth and so sought to commit mass genocide and kill all of humanity. He took control of Ironman's assets and Ironman suits and upgraded them for his evil intentions. Eventually, the Avengers are able to defeat him. (This is all from the live-action version depicted in the MCU)
